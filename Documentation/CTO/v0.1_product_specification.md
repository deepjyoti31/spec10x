## 1. Product Overview

### What It Does

Spec10x v0.1 lets product managers upload raw customer interviews (transcripts, audio, video) and get AI-synthesized insights — themes, pain points, feature requests, sentiment — without any manual tagging, organizing, or pre-categorization.

### Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Zero-config start** | Upload files → get value. No setup wizards, no project creation |
| **AI organizes, not the user** | No projects, no folders. The AI discovers themes across ALL data |
| **Trust through transparency** | Every AI insight links to exact source quotes. Users can verify and correct |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Top-level dashboard is simple; depth is one click away |
| **Speed** | Everything feels instant — streaming responses, optimistic updates |

### What the User Gets

1. **Automatic theme discovery** — AI reads all interviews and clusters them into themes ranked by urgency and frequency
2. **Evidence trails** — Every theme links to exact quotes from exact interviews
3. **Sentiment analysis** — Know if feedback is positive, negative, or mixed
4. **Natural language Q&A** — Ask questions about your interviews in plain English (or any language)
5. **Export** — Get insights as structured markdown or PDF

## 6. Edge Cases & Rules

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Duplicate file uploaded** | SHA-256 hash check → warn: "This file appears to already exist. Upload anyway?" |
| **Non-interview content** | Accept and process. If few/no insights found: flag as "Low insight content" in the sidebar |

| **Video processing** | Extract audio → speech-to-text → discard video. Only store transcript |
| **Contradictory feedback** | Show sentiment split on theme card. Highlight as "Polarizing theme" if split is close to 50/50 |

| **Multilingual interviews** | Process natively. Present insights in user's interface language. Quotes in original language + "Translate" button |
| **Multi-speaker audio/video** | Speaker diarization → Speaker 1, 2, 3… User assigns names in metadata review |
| **Free tier limit reached (10 interviews)** | Upload button shows upgrade prompt. Cannot upload more until upgrading or deleting existing |
